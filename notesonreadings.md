## TOPIC MODELING MARTHA BALLARD’S DIARY
- Martha Ballard's diary: daily enteries for 27 years 
- text mining 
- "how does a reader (computer or human) recognize and conceptualize the recurrent themes that run through nearly 10,000 entries?"
- one way: topic modeling 
- MALLET (Machine Learing for LanguageE ToolkiT), developed by Andrew McCallum
- program was able to produced topics based on words from Ballard's diary 
- from the topics, Cameron Blevins was able to better understand Ballard's diary 
  - examples: 
    - COLD WEATHER topic had words such as cold, windy, chilly, etc & when it's analyzed, it shows the whether for the year 
    - EMOTION topic when analyzed showed Ballard's "emotional" state during the course of the diary & when she discussed her emotions more in certain years, we could look back and see what exactly happened during that time period in her life
