# week-two

##podcast notes:

  -labour of digital history is hidden 
  
  -create a more equitabel field and creates bad history if process/labour kept hidden
  
  -"contextualize your work in the kinds of history you've already done"
  
  ##**Creating a folder:**
 I wanted to organize my images a little bit better and clearer this week so I created a folder to store my screencast videos and images. I used this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxE5bEqmx1s
 
 
 ##**Dowloading programs:**
 
 *Sublimetext:*
 I had issues downloading Sublimetext on my work laptop because I'm not an "adminitrator". I did not want to call help desk at work to let me download it on my personal computer.
