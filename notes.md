# week-two

## podcast notes:

  -labour of digital history is hidden 
  
  -create a more equitabel field and creates bad history if process/labour kept hidden
  
  -"contextualize your work in the kinds of history you've already done"
  
  ## Basic writing and formatting syntax
  I found this https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax super helpful for formatting text & how to format different type of text here.
  
  ## **Creating a folder:**
 I wanted to organize my images a little bit better and clearer this week so I created a folder to store my screencast videos and images. I used this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxE5bEqmx1s
 
 
 ## **Dowloading programs:**
 
 *Sublimetext:*
 I had issues downloading Sublimetext on my work laptop because I'm not an "adminitrator". I did not want to call help desk at work to let me download it on my personal computer. 
 Side note: figured out how to include picture on this page. Since I created an images folder, I have to include "images/" before the title of the image as it's in a different "directory".
